#Mark Visited Elements in the Input Array itself   
since there are multiple duplicates num
that means each nums[abs(num) - 1] index will visit twice 
so when i first visited index we mark it with negative of num
so next time we visit the same index check if its negative then
we visited before we add that num into result
