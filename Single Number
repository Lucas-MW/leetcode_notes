hashmap O(n)  O(n) space
make a default dict
loop through nums increase frequency
loop through dict check if dict value == 1
return 

O(n^2) Space complexity : O(n)O(n). We need a list of size nn to contain elements in nums.
same logic as valid parentheses
make a stack
loop through
if i in stack remove it from stack
else append
return stack
