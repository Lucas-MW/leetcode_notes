O(n) time O(1) space

make default result list to n + 1 length
loop through n + 1
convert each number to bin    
*** hint: bin() or format(n, "b")  both work but format more clear since bin() we have to remove 0b *** 
and make it str and count how many 1's in bin
store the number into result[i]   *** we can do it one line***
return result
