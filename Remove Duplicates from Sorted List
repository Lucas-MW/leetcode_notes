Time complexity : O(n). the total run time is O(n), where nn is the number of nodes in the list.

Space complexity : O(1). No additional space is used.

need two pointer
while curr and curr.next
temp = curr.next
if curr val and temp val same:
curr.next = temp.next
temp = curr.next
else
curr = curr.next
temp = temp.next
return head
