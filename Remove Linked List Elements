Time complexity: O(N)

Space complexity: O(1), it's a constant space solution.

keep track of prev node
while loop:
if curr value == val:
also have to check if it is first val then prev.next not working since prev is none from start
if prev is none:
move head
else:
connect prev to curr next
else:
prev = curr

curr = curr.next
return head
