0(n) time O(1) space

use floyed cycle detection algo

slow and fast to first element of array

while true
slow move one step   slow = nums[slow]
fast move two step    fast = nums[nums[fast]]
if slow == fast we break the loop since we found cycle entry

now we move slow to starting point
while slow != fast
slow move one step
fast move one step

after while loop return slow
