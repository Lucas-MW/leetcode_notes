O(n)
we also need to find min val because of negative numbers
edge case: when there is a 0 break our algo

loop through each number
if number is 0 so edge case occur:
we set min and max to 1 ( since we are going to num * min and num * max so product dont change)
min = min of number , number * min , number * max
max = max of number , number * min(min going to change because previous min value, so need a value to store) , numebr * max
result is max(max , result)
return
