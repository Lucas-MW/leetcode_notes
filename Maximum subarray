#**********Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm*********
iterative dynamic programming algorithm. 
calculates the maximum sum subarray ending at a particular position by using the maximum sum subarray ending at the previous position.

largest and subarray sum is first number of array
loop through each nums from index 1:
find max from num and subarray_sum
find max from subarray_sum and largest_sum
return
