1: recursion  O(n)
list(left tree and root and right tree)

2: iterative O(n)
while current is not none and stack is not empty
while current is not none
move current into stack
move current to left
after current reach the bottom of left tree 
make current to pop item from stack and add item value to the result
and move current to the right
and return
